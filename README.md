What is a “game” anyway?

[“Play” it on GameJolt.](https://gamejolt.com/games/macrosergeon/245614)

Made for [#BadBoxArt2017](http://jams.gamejolt.io/badboxart2017/)
(except I started too late
and more or less gave up
and then picked it up again to at least make a joke out of it
and frantically added a “story”
and so there isn't much to it.)
